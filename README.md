## Introduction
Emotion Recognition with CNNs â€“ Balanced and Optimized! ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

I just completed a fascinating project on Emotion Recognition using CNNs, where I tackled the common 
challenge of class imbalance in facial expression datasets. Using the FER-2013 dataset, I focused on 
classifying "Happy" vs "Neutral" emotions and applied a hybrid balancing approachâ€”oversampling the minority 
class (Neutral) with smart data augmentation (flip, brightness, rotation) and downsampling the majority class 
(Happy) to create a perfectly balanced dataset. This pipeline, built with Python, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-image,
prepares the data for deep learning models while ensuring fairness and performance. This project highlights the 
critical role of data preprocessing in AI and paves the way for more accurate emotion recognition systems in 
applications like healthcare, education, and smart devices. Check out the full blog and code repository for more 
insights!
